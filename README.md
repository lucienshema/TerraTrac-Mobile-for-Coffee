# TerraTrac-Mobile-for-Coffee
The TerraTrac App for Coffee by TechnoServe Labs supports EUDR compliance, allowing users to record plot geolocations offline. It also lets users buy coffee directly from farmers or through Akrabis and download plot data in CSV or GeoJSON. Users can manage purchases, track reports, and ensure traceability.
